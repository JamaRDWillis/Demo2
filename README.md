Student experiences vary from person to person, but one thing most students struggle with are finances. Once students graduate, theyâ€™re met with more financial struggles like paying off their loans and debts. The average student borrower will spend up to 20 years to pay their debt. This can be a headache after transitioning out of college into the real-world. This application will help students, especially graduating students, budget their money during and after school. Our application will give students a visual representation in a graph of their income vs spending, give them options to manages expenses, and manage debt. Students will be given a questionarre asking about expenses and will have a profile to enter phone number, email, expenses, and income.
